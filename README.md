# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

We have build a logistic regression model based on the transaction data provided to us. The data provided to us was very imbalanced data set. Hence, for building a proper logistic model on top of that we have used some balancing techniques like (ROS,SMOTE etc) to balance the data and applied some of very popular logistic regression models like Random Forest, Logistic regression and some boosting techniques like XGBoost to catch any frud transactions. In our scenario Accuracy was not a concerning Evaluation criteria and we focussed more on Recall and AUC. We finally able to build a proper logistic model and predicted on test data and the results were satisfying. We were also able to figure out the variables which will be important in detecting any fraud transactions
